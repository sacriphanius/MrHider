# MrHider
This Python script provides a simple interface for hiding and extracting files.
It presents a menu to the user, allowing them to choose between two operations: file hiding or file extraction.

- The `hide` function hides the specified file inside the target file.
- The `extract` function extracts the hidden data from the specified target file and saves it into a new file.
- The `main` function displays the menu options to the user and performs the selected operation based on their choice. It prompts the user for file paths and handles error conditions during the operations.

This script can be used to hide and extract files. The hidden data is inserted into the target file without altering the original file's content. The extraction operation retrieves the hidden data from the target file, allowing you to obtain the original data.
